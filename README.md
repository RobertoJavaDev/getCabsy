  <h1>getCabsy - Cab Booking System</h1>
</div>


The **getCabsy** project is an individually developed real-time cab booking system designed to streamline the process of reserving rides for users. The system provides comprehensive functionality for three primary user roles: customers, drivers, and administrators.

The project adheres to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, ensuring a robust and scalable foundation for future development. It leverages modern practices, such as RESTful API architecture, for seamless communication between the back-end and front-end components.

This project is not only a practical exploration of building a full-stack application but also serves as a hands-on educational endeavor, pushing the boundaries of personal learning and problem-solving in Java development. ðŸš–
